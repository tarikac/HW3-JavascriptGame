# HW3-JavascriptGame
This will be the place of my game. I am debating between which came to actually build. info will be updated.
Trying to update the name is actually wasn't a quick fix. since I already submitted the assignment with this name! I did not think about that when I submitted.

I did the Psychic Game. I did not give myself enough time to complete as I did with other assignments.
There are aspects of this that I want to fix and update. Including appending and propery increments for tries and resetting whenever there is a winning guess.
